# 1stProject

## Description

- I felt there was not a userfriendly web application to compare real time financial data on stocks
- So I built this application called Compstock because I wanted to compare specific financial ratios between companies easily.
- I learned how to use java to insert rows into a table on html and how to run multiple apis for the information within the tables
